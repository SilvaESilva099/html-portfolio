<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time are:</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Twelve Angry Men</h3>

<p>This is a great movie about a teenage boy being judged on false accusations. The verdict has to be unanimous and most of the men present don't really care much about the case, however there is one that believes that this young man deserves a fair trial, and will fight to the end to turn that into a reality.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
        
<p>This is my girlfriend's favorite Ghibli movie. And it was my first Ghibli as well.</p>

<h3>Trainspotting</h3>

<p>Choose life.
    Choose a job.
    Choose a career.
    Choose a family,
    Choose a fucking big television
    Choose washing machines, cars,
    Compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.
    Choose good health, low cholesterol
    And dental insurance.
    Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments.
    Choose a starter home.
    Choose your friends.
    Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.
    Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase
    In a range of fucking fabrics.
    Choose DIY and wondering who you
    Are on a Sunday morning.
    Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing
    Sprit-crushing ga me shows
    Stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.
    Choose rotting away at the end of it all,
    Pishing you last in a miserable home
    Nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish,
    Fucked-up brats
    You have spawned to replace yourself.
    Choose your future. Choose life.
